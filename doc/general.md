I will first study how adding contacts affects the discrete states inside the conducting region.

Vectorisation is crucial when doing matrix computations. Do not use list comprehensions when calculating for different energies, instead make the functions vectorisable. It takes more time but the time spent in development pays off in faster prototyping.
The speedups can be anything like 60x (surface_g calculation) to 4x(dos calculation)
